# weight-tracker

weight-tracker is a personal project of mine for documenting my weight changes (and hopefully loss)

## What is it

A python django webapp that can collect weight record data from [Libra](https://libra-app.eu/), store the data in its own database, and display this data

## Whats next

- Deployment to cloud service
    - Deployment to local rasberry pi?
- Data visualisation with plotly
- Better data importing
- Authorisation for data importing
